# Use Cloudflare for DDNS
Using the Cloudflare API, you can make your domian's DNS records forllow your dynamic ip address automatically.  
  
See the instructions on the files.  
Place the files somewhere, and set up a cron job to run `cloudflare-ddns.sh` automatically every 5 minutes.  
You will only need `cloudflare-dns-id.sh` when setting up.  
  
Good luck. You are on your own.
